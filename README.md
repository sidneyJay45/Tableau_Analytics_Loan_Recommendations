# Tableau Dashboard: Loan Approval Process

## Overview

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the loan approval process, focusing on grouping loan seekers based on their credit scores and other factors to identify those who are likely to repay their loans without difficulty. The dashboard offers insights into the relationship between credit scores, loan history, and financial states, enabling lenders to make informed decisions.

## Key Features

2. Loan Approval Likelihood: Loan seekers with a credit score of 500 or above are considered likely to be approved for a loan.
3. Grouped Tiles: Loan seekers with a credit score of 500 or above are further grouped into tiles based on their loan history and financial 
   states. This allows lenders to identify individuals who are less likely to cause repayment issues.
4. Repayment Risk Assessment: The dashboard provides a visual representation of the repayment risk associated with each loan seeker, considering 
   their credit score, loan history, and financial states.
